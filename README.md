# Playwright - 100 Tests Showcase

This repository contains 100 different example Playwright tests across a variety of public demo sites and pages.
They are intended for learning, portfolio, and demonstration purposes. Tests are simple and self-contained.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run all tests (may be slow):
```bash
npx playwright test
```

3. Run a single test file:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/test001.spec.ts
```

> Note: These are example tests. Update selectors if pages change or to target your own app.
